This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This application is a implementation of a card game called War. In this game, we divide a 52 cards deck evenly between two players. Each player reveal the card at the top of their deck. The player with the highest value card wins both cards. If both cards have the same value, the players reveal their next card, until one player has a higher value card. The game ends when one player has all the cards.

##Technologies used
For this application, I used React.

##Context
This application was made for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. You can find more information about this challenge [on this blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.1u78otwpn)
